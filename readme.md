Let's imagine a strange virus hits the planet Earth : shopkeepers and restaurants are forced to find solutions in order to continue serving the public. Your mission, if you accept it, is to digitize the processes of the different companies affected by this terrible pandemic...

## Project infos

## What is this project about :grey_question:

This is a web development exercise carried out with the BECODE training to learn various aspects and coding techniques. Here there will be HTML, CSS according to everyone's preferences and alsoJavaScript.

## Objectif

- create the ordering site for a restaurant
- minimum 2 web pages 
- where it is visible: the dishes and the opening hours

### Pre-requisite :bowtie:

What you need to get started ...

- basics in **HTML**
- basics in **CSS**
- basics in **JavaScript**
- Top work mates or a good ability to do internet research on your own :muscle: 

## What did I used ?

- Tag Html
- Script Css

Front end :
- Regex
- intervals
- Date
- Element 
- Event
- DOM
etc.

## Strength

- I learned intensively through this exercise and these difficulties.
- The result is rather nice, when you have never done this before in your life and the coding is all new to you.
- Using Framework is easy.

## Weaknesse

- I didn't have a basic knowledge of JavaSript ...:disappointed:
So it was hard for me to know which way to go.
- I needed more time to finish the project 

## Advice

Frameworks can make your life easier, but they can also make it more complicated.

Remember to master HTML to make sure that some things in the framework are useful. The strength of an HTLM is in its clarity so always be efficient and concise.
